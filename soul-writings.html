                    <h3>Leadership</h3>
                    <p>
                        One day a while ago I had a conversation with a client and co-workers about workplace 
                        scenarios and how our bosses affect us. By no means do I understand the commerce world 
                        and I've only worked in a few jobs where there was a structure and hierarchy of who 
                        does what position and how it's directed. <a href="soul-blog/leadership.html"

                    <h3>Pain as a teacher</h3>
                    <p>
                        Writing about my experiences, ideas, and feelings openly is a new process for me. 
                        Much arises when it comes to sharing too much of myself and being judged, and much 
                        arises that if I write something, am I owning it? It's easy to preach with out 
                        walking the talk. So it becomes a refinement of if I am just spewing off a bunch of 
                        mumbo-jumbo, or if you actually met me in person, can I really have integrity for 
                        what I say. <a href="soul-blog/pain-teacher.html">Read more</a>

                    <h3>Walking With Impact</h3>
                    <p>
                        In reflecting about who I am becoming and where I am going, it often comes into my 
                        awareness about the impact that someone might have upon my life. It's easy to take 
                        for granted sometimes that one little choice we make can have significant effects 
                        that ripple out on our lives and perhaps the world. <a href="soul-blog/impact.html">Read more</a>

                    <h3>Caring as an evolved Masculine Principle</h3>
                    <p>
                        None of my writings are intended to be a gender exclusive assumption. Every living human 
                        has both masculine and feminine energies that they navigate through life. I personally 
                        can't say I'm and expert on any of them, yet what I can say is that though I can swing 
                        from both feminine and masculine energies. <a href="soul-blog/caring.html">Read more</a>
