                <h3>Lilith, the Dark Goddess</h3>
                    <p>
                        In our modern culture, the concept of dark has connotations of something to be 
                        feared, avoided, and is emphasized as taboo. The dark is something unknown to us, 
                        and as egoic humans, we tend to want to stay in the known. We may avoid the dark, 
                        where the shadows lie, and as such it becomes something that festers and broods 
                        until it comes out in unhealthy and toxic ways. As a result, darkness has become 
                        something to be controlled, dismissed, shamed, and vilified at all costs.

                    <h3>Saturn, Capricorn: a quick introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Saturn is our body, our form. It gives us the definition of our structure. Anything 
                        that gives us structure also strengthens us. How we are strengthened in reality is 
                        how we mature. Maturation gives us the ability to operate in a socially confined 
                        reality, thus revealing our authority. Authority governs rules which are needed to 
                        operate successfully in a social reality. To operate in a social reality means we 
                        must be able to conform to that social structure. A social structure create 
                        hierarchy, however within a hierarchy we are invited to establish our own inner 
                        authority. <a href="astro-blog/Saturn-quick.html" style="color:tomato">Read more</a>
