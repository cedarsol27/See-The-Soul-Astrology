                <p class="pblog">    
                    In reflecting about who I am becoming and where I am going, it often comes into my 
                    awareness about the impact that someone might have upon my life. It's easy to take 
                    for granted sometimes that one little choice we make can have significant effects 
                    that ripple out on our lives and perhaps the world. For example, choosing to make a 
                    new relationship, going to a new event that may not be an event you may not choose 
                    to go to normally, making new connections. Or sometimes it's just saying the right 
                    thing at the right time to cause a cascade of events that shape someone's life.

                    I've certainly had a number of those life changing simple choices. I've met many 
                    people who just off a whim I say yes to do something, and my whole life is different 
                    because I made that choice.

                    Yesterday I met up with someone I hadn't seen in 8 years. It was this morning I had 
                    realized the impact she made on my life the last time we chatted.

                <p>
                    We both went to high school together, and during the later years, say junior year, 
                    is when we met. We both smoked a lot of pot with a not-so inspiring group of people, 
                    skipping school, getting into trouble for smoking, and just being rebellious were the 
                    activities we both chose. Thankfully, I don't recall either one of us getting arrested.

                    Change happened during our senior year, and I think she moved away, so she drifted from 
                    my awareness. At 21 I started to get into some really hard drugs, and did a lot of them. 
                    About that time she showed up randomly, visiting her father in my home town. Some of 
                    the conversations we had we not so pleasant for me because I was getting into crystal 
                    meth at that time, knowing that where I was at in my life was soul-crushing. In a way, 
                    she sat there with me, in compassion, hoping I would see the goodness in my heart to 
                    start changing my life; in a way she was calling to me to get out of that small town.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We drifted apart again shortly after, mostly through my own doing, and had a series of 
                    events that at 22 I decided to get out Arlington, my home town, and into Seattle. Hands 
                    down the best choice of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meeting with her last night revealed to me so much about what transpired those days 8 
                    years ago. The reflection of our encounter revealed just how much I have grown, despite 
                    my daily struggles within myself. I felt empowered, strong, courageous, and confident 
                    that my choices had really helped bring me to today. And all it took was compassion 
                    for a hurt little boy those fateful days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is but one person who has walked this journey with me at some point, and so much 
                    gratitude is felt in my heart for these people. Some are fortunate enough to make a 
                    choice for their own empowerment, and others choose to stay within the confines of their 
                    personal safety, regardless on how their choices affect them. Either way, we all have 
                    people walking by our side for any length of period, as we walk by theirs. Never take 
                    for granted those little choices we make, nor those people who walk by our side.
