            <article style="line-height:3em;"><h2>Caring as an evolved Masculine principle</h2><hr>
                <p class="pblog">    
                    None of my writings are intended to be a gender exclusive assumption. Every living human 
                    has both masculine and feminine energies that they navigate through life. I personally 
                    can't say I'm and expert on any of them, yet what I can say is that though I can swing 
                    from both feminine and masculine energies. My own evolutionary path is strengthening the 
                    masculine energies in my own life. I recommend that if you are interested in learning 
                    about the various feminine and masculine energies to read such appropriate authors and 
                    teachers. And if you are gender-neutral or transgendered, I recommend seeking out 
                    individuals who have researched this area better than I have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There can be some curiosity about what how feminine and masculine energies can be expressed. 
                    I experience them as ultimately mysterious, essentially unresolvable especially when it 
                    comes to a form of union, simply because they are intended to be opposites. No one person 
                    can possible comprehend the Universe it's self, and we can only have an experience of the 
                    mystery, never fully possessing all of the wisdom it holds. As all things come from one 
                    source, so too all things return, with only a borrowed lens of what has been discovered 
                    through the journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have mapped out some expressions of the basic masculine and feminine energies based off 
                    three levels of being. There is the archetypal realm, the superconscious human realm, and 
                    the conscious/unconscious human realm. This is just one perspective. The archetypal realm 
                    deals with the basic building blocks of all manifestation, such as consciousness (masculine) 
                    and form (feminine). Then there is the superconscious realm, which ultimately is the 
                    idealization of the masculine and feminine energies. These may look like warrior of presence 
                    (masculine) and the creatrix of beauty (feminine).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then there's the conscious/unconscious manifestations of masculine/feminine. In a western 
                    culture, men and women are encouraged to reinforce certain standards. Men are to be 
                    “masculine” and women are to be “feminine”.  As masculine energies may look like muscles, 
                    war, competition, or even more mundane things like sports, especially contact, cars, guns, 
                    and the ever-so prevalent expression of chasing after women. Basically what we commonly call 
                    “man things”. These are essentially base forms, or lower conscious forms of expression of 
                    the masculine energies here on earth, which can vary depending on the society and that 
                    culture it is viewed from. As for the feminine, the mundane may look like fashion, anti-aging 
                    efforts, and other ways of beauty, child-rearing and home caring. “What women do.” Again, 
                    these are just lower forms of expression, and by no means are comprehensive or intended to be 
                    a sexist view point. It's basically a concept of an artificially created structure to adhere 
                    to in order to be a “normal” participant of society, myopic and unevolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But evolution drives us to climb to higher heights, and transcending with inclusion of 
                    previous expressions of any configuration. In other words, what we have previously experienced 
                    before becomes something to grow and change from, but never leaving behind the purest and 
                    unrefined forms of expression. For example, it is intended that feminine qualities still rule 
                    beauty, and masculine qualities still rule drive. Keep in mind that men can be beautiful and 
                    women can be driven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of an evolutionary path, it is possible that the two opposing energies of masculine and 
                    feminine will become less polarized and have a deeper union, which is called for in times when 
                    old paradigms are no longer useful or purposeful. This is why we see more women becoming leaders 
                    and CEO's while more men are becoming stay at home dads, and more emotionally available. We need 
                    not project onto the other for something we can develop within ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing I am personally working with is a higher expression of masculine energies. So what can 
                    I say as a direct experience of what an evolving masculine energy look like?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through my experiences, both inwardly and outwardly, I tend to see men essentially as little boys. 
                    Within that I mean both the light and shadow elements of what male children are: playful, energetic, 
                    silly, and immature, and childish. At times, it may appear that there hasn't been an opportunity to 
                    experience influence from important male role-models to help these boys develop into men as they move 
                    through life. In my experience, it is, in fact, rare to see true men functioning in daily lives of 
                    both men and boys. Still, “boys are boys” in the sense it's hard to want to grow up, for better or 
                    worse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a boy, I remember reading a book that impacted the way I wanted to interact with the world. This 
                    book is titled Chicken Soup for the Soul. What I took away from a specific story was that I wanted 
                    to bring care to those I came into contact with. It wasn't shortly after reading that when one day 
                    I was outside playing at recess. It was fall and the weather was cool and cloudy, when one of the 
                    other boys on the playground expressed his discomfort in the cool weather. I had this very warm 
                    jacket that day, and due to the influence of that particular book, I offer this uncomfortable boy 
                    my jacket. As a result, I did end up neglecting my own desire for warmth, but I also felt a sense 
                    of joy and love for this other boy with my offering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had many experiences like this, where I would find the suffering, or at least discomfort of 
                    another individual, and make some sort of sacrifice or offering to the troubled other. However, 
                    in school, this brought me some repercussions. Most boys, as I experienced, weren't really all 
                    that gentle and caring towards others, especially towards each other. I made a few friends in my 
                    earlier days who were somewhat kind and caring, but eventually most of them, including myself, 
                    grew up to be quite cruel. Thanks hormones! Though most of those cruel experiences were based off 
                    of projection and insecurity for my own caring nature, I had more than enough circumstances where 
                    I truly was a being of care and love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the wounds of shame from fellow peers, especially other boys, I managed to keep the nature 
                    of caring alive, but struggled with the image that “men should be aggressive and uncaring.” Inside 
                    of me was also this emotional nature, and I found much difficulty in sharing and expressing my 
                    emotions. I sometimes tried to hide behind the perceived false image of macho, but readily failed 
                    because I couldn't possibly comprehend the purpose or actions of what “being a man” was. Even if I 
                    stepped out of line, I would eventually come back into apologizing for my false nature, and really 
                    seeing that any forced attempt to portray myself as any kind of aggressive individual would backfire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've had many friends who were teachers of caring over the years, and quite honestly, I sometimes 
                    missed the lesson being presented to me. In that time, I befriended one particular individual who 
                    expressed deep care for most everyone they came into contact with. A sweet and gentle man, whom oddly 
                    enough I began to call my mother, took me under his wing and showed a particular sense of care that 
                    most individuals do not express. He was the kind of person to literally give you the shirt off his 
                    back. More than enough times did he give his life force energy into ensuring that others would see 
                    the day of someone thinking of them and attuned to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently he passed over. This has had a great affect on me, and I have known for a while that his 
                    passing would come. His passing was a reminder to feel how an individual can express care for so many 
                    people, and a reminder to not take that for granted. “You'll never realize how much you miss someone 
                    until their gone” was a phrase I used often when I was in my teens. This statement became evident again 
                    with his passing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another recent experience revealed to me a depth of my nature, an authentic expression of who I truly 
                    am: a caring man. Well, it's really no surprise to me or anyone else, yet this experience was something 
                    accessible only to be felt through my beingness, taking away all of the false-images and stories I held 
                    about hiding my essence. I see a lot of men out there much less than caring, and I have interacted with 
                    many of them. It is difficult being who I am when caring is not a value they hold. My mentor shared with 
                    me that some people are going to hate me at first meeting because of my nature. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've shared a lot of story and backdrop to make an attempt to bring a point. Healthy masculine energy is 
                    a principle based off an evolutionary point for masculine archetypes. A warrior archetype holds a gentle 
                    fierceness for all those who live. A warrior archetype also holds the keys to loving compassion, knowing 
                    that all beings suffer at some point, and holding that key in one's heart witness with a great sensitivity 
                    to presence of compassion and acceptance. And a man with a steadfast resilience of that compassion in his 
                    heart is the greatest warrior he can become.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is my own experience that I need purpose. Masculine energy needs purpose, and the archetype of 
                    masculine energy uses love as his purpose. It could be love of the family, love for his comrades, love 
                    for his task, whatever it may be, but regardless of what the object of his our pouring love may be, the 
                    fact remains a masculine energy is best suited for putting his love into everything he does.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Putting love into the well being of all creatures is the highest expression of this masculine energy. He 
                    is the one who holds space for all creation. He is the one to protect those in need. He is the one who 
                    ensures the survival of the next seven generations. He is the one who puts his base desires aside so that 
                    when he comes into contact with another, a deeper intimacy and connection can be expressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He allows the feminine to express all of her nature without objection. He brings compassionate wisdom o 
                    those whom are lost. He reminds us that there is a path of truth, and that truth is the true nature of 
                    our being.
