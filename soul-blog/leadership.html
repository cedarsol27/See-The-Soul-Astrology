            <article style="line-height:3em;"><h2>Leadership</h2><hr>
                <p class="pblog">One day a while ago I had a conversation with a client and co-workers about workplace scenarios and how our bosses affect us. By no means do I understand the commerce world and I've only worked in a few jobs where there was a structure and hierarchy of who does what position and how it's directed. In these places, I've seen some unbalanced tiers of how one person directs what tasks need to be done, and who is doing them. Often times I have discovered that “management” isn't very supportive of their employees underneath them, often times looking at them as a place of inferiority/superiority complexes. And as one of my mentors has said, arrogance is where you are better than me or I am better than you; with this comes isolation, further placing me away from you.</p>
                <p>The term management somewhat sounds like manage, like “I'll manage.” No where does manage sound like thrive. The best ways to thrive aligns more with the term “lead.” So where are our leaders?</p>
                <p>Management deals more with sorting through, and designating and delegating tasks. A leader does that, but so much more, like inspire. I cannot think of hardly any situations where my “superiors” help inspire me to do better with the company I represent. So often I experience through my practice many people who hardly know what they are working for, and what the ultimate purpose of their direction is leading them to. That's what a leader helps us to do; remind us what we stand for.</p>
                <p>What I see in a leader, a true leader, happens to be just as human as the rest of us, but also paves the way to inspire us to become our own source of power.</p>
                <p>I don't know a lot of history, especially religious teachings, but what I do know of Christ is that he portrayed himself as a simple man, owning his faults, teaching others ways to inspire themselves. On his death bed, he massaged his disciples feet, and they questioned why he would bring himself to service in that way. His simple message was that of “I am no different than you, and just because I offer another way of being, doesn't make me better than you. All you need to know is that all rests within you.”</p>
                <p>Some important traits of a true leader in our workplace, homes, friends, etc. are very radical for our times. Empathy. Knowing how others feel and being able to relate, or at least be present and supportive of their followers circumstances. I've only worked with one person that would listen and take to heart when I confronted them about how I felt about situations. Often times, however, they may just say, “well, that's just how things work around here.” Knowing there are challenges in our lives, our homes, work, and relationships can really bring heart, connection, and trust between two or more people with empathy. But how often are we really safe enough without becoming “too sensitive” or “too weak.” Look within yourself; how often can you say, “I am having a struggle right now, and could really use support from someone, or something out there which will really help me”?</p>
                <p>Another important trait is vulnerability. Connecting with what I said above, sometimes we are having a bad day, and to be able to share that and say “I really need support, even as a leader” can really bridge the gap of human connection, let alone be surprised to see who shows up, and help you out in the situation. I don't feel that if someone is consistently having crisis after crisis can be a strong leader, and may need to re-evaluate their position. However, showing up in your humanness and allowing yourself to share where you are at can be refreshing especially when you discover people ready to help support the cause of the company.</p>
                <p>Be excited to do your work right, but be even more excited to make mistakes. That's a hard one, but sometimes taking a risk won't be as disastrous as one may think. And if it is, then you can learn how to do better. Better doesn't exist if good doesn't crack. Look at all of your mistakes and see that those mistakes shape who we are, giving us wisdom, and wisdom is far more powerful than knowledge, because wisdom is the application of knowledge.</p>
                <p>Allow yourself to say you were wrong. I often do. And if you need to defend yourself, then you must question if what you are defending is actually true to you. Really, is it true to you?</p>
