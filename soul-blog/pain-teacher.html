                <p class="pblog">
                    Writing about my experiences, ideas, and feelings openly is a new process for me. 
                    Much arises when it comes to sharing too much of myself and being judged, and much 
                    arises that if I write something, am I owning it? It's easy to preach with out 
                    walking the talk. So it becomes a refinement of if I am just spewing off a bunch of 
                    mumbo-jumbo, or if you actually met me in person, can I really have integrity for 
                    what I say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you know me, you'd know I'm a relatively loving person, with a big heart. Besides 
                    that fact, on a poster board that I made, I have a picture with the words “Dark Hero.” 
                    I wondered why I chose to paste that on my board, but as I am discovering with the way 
                    I think, perceive, talk, and look through life, I am beginning to understand why I 
                    selected such a bizarre phrase; I can withstand diving deep into the darker aspects of 
                    life. Having lived much of a life living in extremes, I can safely say I've experienced 
                    many situations, mostly by choice, some by childhood, that push me to an edge. Whether 
                    it be speaking truth that is far too uncomfortable, getting as high as I can to see 
                    where it would take me, or even being at rest, laying in my bed just to be, gives me a 
                    life lived of experience. My journey hasn't been outward, traveling the world, but 
                    inward, seeking the depths of my own human experience. I am both a light and shadow 
                    chaser.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    Since I've been a person to keep pain close to me and also choosing a path of healing, 
                    forgiveness, and growth, I can say I'm leaning toward the name “Dark Hero.” But what 
                    kind of role does keeping pain so close to me have?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Laying in bed, I was watching my mind try to create stories around how inadequate I 
                    was. Many traditions teach about not believing in the mind, to not listen to the 
                    stories. This is very true, but what if no matter how much you meditate, contemplate, 
                    take workshops, heal, etc. they still seem to be there? I'm beginning to discover that 
                    there is a very important reason to hear those self-sabotaging ways.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    Over the years, I've contemplated suicide. That's a subject that many people have a 
                    hard time listening to. “Somethings wrong, you've got to fix it!” It's true, you do 
                    need to seek some help if you are considering suicide, but rather than offing yourself, 
                    what is it that the voice is trying to tell you? Something in your life is not working 
                    and needs to be addressed.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    Yet something even deeper in that subject is the fact so called negative emotions need 
                    to be dealt with, they are the basic driving force which forces us to explore ourselves, 
                    and to explore life. Even beliefs of not being good enough, at some point will drive a 
                    person to know their pain. Then they will seek healing.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    I've chosen my path of transformation because I can admit that most days I feel something 
                    painful. And rather than having ended my life several years back, I've been more curious 
                    as to know just what is beyond that perception of life. If I have to spend the rest of my 
                    life, living until an old age, my determination compels me to seek more of what is behind 
                    the curtain, the man pulling the strings. Who is this Wizard of Oz?
                </p>
                <p>     
                    Not everyone has the capacity in this moment to seek within themselves. Many people avoid 
                    it their whole life. I have a tendency to believe we reincarnate, and many, many spiritual 
                    traditions offer this perspective. Leaving the possibility that it is true, one may live 
                    several lifetimes without seeking within, causing pain and strife for themselves and 
                    others. Alas, there will become a breaking point in ones journey, where they will question 
                    their pain, and seek to know it's purpose.
                </p>

                    Life is about the journey, not the destination. Knowing our pain, and holding it dear to 
                    our hearts can bring so much meaning to our lives. Take for example the picture above. 
                    This is the left over process of embodying my pain, more specifically the frequency of 
                    anger. Smashing dishes as a ritual was suggested by a mentor of mine. I took this to heart 
                    one afternoon feeling that containing my anger was unbearable. Setting a sacred container, 
                    along with prayer, I smashed the dishes one by one, announcing my “ritual of anger.” By the 
                    end of the smashing, prior to clean up, I sat down, feeling grief. After about 15 minutes of 
                    just staring at the mess, I had to clean it up. Once I closed the ritual and drove home, I 
                    felt an overwhelming sense of joy and excitement. Everything within me and around me, 
                    including my spirit allies, were praising the experience. My pain, embodied, and channeled 
                    taught me to really show up for my anger, and by showing up to the moment, I was showing up 
                    to the world.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    We have many rituals about joy. I don't find too many rituals about the darker side of life, 
                    set in a sacred way, especially anger. Now I didn't have anyone around to bear witness my 
                    process, but it appears whether alone, or with community, having a ritual for all of our 
                    experiences is a healthy, and greatly needed celebration.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    Pain becomes a great teacher, when we listen and embody it. Often times feeling it is just 
                    enough, but other times call for expression. Whether the approach of smashing dishes, dancing, 
                    or as where I heard somewhere about shotgun painting, where you take a blank canvas, a shotgun, 
                    and some colored paint and shoot the cans of paint onto the canvas, having a regular expression 
                    of pain and celebrating it brings profound healing. And living life is an art. So is breaking 
                    some plates!
