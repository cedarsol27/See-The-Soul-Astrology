                        When we cast our shadow on to others, we throw away our capacity for honest and safe 
                        relationships. -Demetra George

                    In our modern culture, the concept of dark has connotations of something to be feared, 
                    avoided, and is emphasized as taboo. The dark is something unknown to us, and as egoic 
                    humans, we tend to want to stay in the known. We may avoid the dark, where the shadows 
                    lie, and as such it becomes something that festers and broods until it comes out in 
                    unhealthy and toxic ways. As a result, darkness has become something to be controlled, 
                    dismissed, shamed, and vilified at all costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dark can resemble aspects of death, dying, pain, trauma, abuse, and everything that 
                    symbolizes issues we contract around. The way through is by doing healing, 
                    self-reflection, and self-honesty. We have to be willing to dive into our own hearts, 
                    our depths, and courageously look at each thing we fear to contact with resiliency, 
                    compassion, and ultimately deep understanding. “I may not like what I discover, but I 
                    do have a choice to cultivate love for that space.” This is where we can begin to have 
                    a relationship with being uncomfortable, and if we allow ourselves, discomfort can 
                    become comfort, so long as we are not creating tension around our discomfort. Otherwise 
                    the results of suppressed shadow comes out as projections or actions from us that 
                    reveals a level of immaturity and/or inappropriate behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though some attributes of darkness is painful, it is not just about pain and suffering 
                    and includes the mysterious elements of existence; elements and teachings in which we 
                    cannot fully comprehend. The Dark Goddess, one aspect of the feminine, historically has 
                    ruled over the mysteries that encompass aspects of the occult, in the hidden products of 
                    creation. Despite cultural misconceptions of the word occult, it truly means hidden. The 
                    teachings of the Dark Goddess of the Dark Moon are concerned with divination, magic, 
                    healing, sacred sexuality, the non-physical dimensions of being, and the mysteries of 
                    birth, death, and regeneration, all pointing to aspects of mystery and that which is 
                    hidden. In a similar manner these dark moon teachings, now called pseudo-sciences, have 
                    been rejected as legitimate areas of inquiry by modern religious and educational 
                    institutions(1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dark also represents the night sky, and besides the stars, which are ever-present, 
                    the moon is the only light we can see in the dark. Yes, there are days out of every month 
                    that the moon becomes invisible, and with this we extrapolate this symbolic darkness, and 
                    particularly within the dark moon. Many cultures see the time when the moon is invisible 
                    as a time of decay, death, and regeneration: those very fears we associate with darkness. 
                    In our current control system which society calls the Patriarchy, that which we fear must 
                    be controlled. Fear is the “antithesis” of the courageous “man”. In order to conquer fear, 
                    one must dominate it, much like how the Patriarchy has dominated the feminine. It is an 
                    ironic statement to utilize methods of control to prevent fear as control is essentially 
                    rooted in fear.

                    In order to begin to perhaps understand why there is control over the darkness, we can 
                    start by looking into the mythologies that surround the mysteries of the unknown. In 
                    essence, the Dark Goddess has several representations that accompany different 
                    psychological and spiritual dimensions depending on how she expresses through us. Different 
                    cultures give her different names such as Innana, Hekate, Demeter, Isis, Kali, and further 
                    which all have similar representations of Her. For the purpose of this writing, Lilith will 
                    be the invocation to unravel the suppressed nature of her original divinity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lilith represents the wild feminine. Etymologically, the Sumarian word “lil” translates into 
                    wind. The feminine in her true essence is indeed quite wild, with raw emotion, changing 
                    emotional states, and wisdom with the cycles of life. Take a look at nature as her 
                    expression. Nature is at times quite violent, with surging power that no human, animal, or 
                    plant can defend against in it's raging nature. Volcanoes, monsoons, tornadoes, droughts, 
                    wildfires, and other elements of the stormy nature can wipe out an entire section of land 
                    and population with little problem. And still, there are more moments of serenity that is 
                    felt within the seasons that show a particular balance that is required for any kind of life 
                    to survive, let alone thrive. This is the wisdom inherent within nature. Her wildness as 
                    nature is clearly uncontrollable and not fully knowable. No matter our opinion on the state 
                    she arrives in, she expresses herself unapologetically, which brings us to how she represents 
                    being autonomous, doing what she needs to do, and experiencing a body of intelligence 
                    knowing what she needs to create that balance. Symbolically as her archetype within us, this 
                    brings an intense relating with self, nature, and others. This is our primal, raw, emotional 
                    relating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We musn't judge nature in her unpredictability for the reasons and impacts of these 
                    patterns creates a bed for the future seeds of creation to grow and sprout. Not all seeds 
                    will germinate and survive, but as we can reflect, somehow this chaos brings an inherent 
                    pattern of cohesion that sustains life to exist. It is not rational, but it works! Somehow 
                    between the symbolic fabrics of life and myth, the wild nature of the feminine fell into a 
                    pit of oppression.

                    Looking into the myths of Lilith has been a difficult task because of the inconsistencies 
                    and hidden nature of Her story, which is ironically very relevant to her essence. However, 
                    from the research gathered, she makes several appearances in different scriptures of the 
                    religious pantheons. One of her first appearances is found in the Israelite tradition. In 
                    Isaiah 34:14 it is written:
                </p>
                <div class="quote">
                    <blockquote>
                        Wildcats shall meet hyenas, Goat-demons shall greet each other; there too the lilit 
                        shall repose 	and find Her resting place.
                    </blockquote>
                </div>    
                <p>
                    There is debate on the translation of “lilit” which could mean a night out, or indeed Her 
                    as the archetype. Regardless of the meaning, we can extrapolate that this still interpreted 
                    as darkness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lilith appears in another scripture of the Talmud. In Shabbat 151a it is written:
                </p>
                <div class="quote">
                    <blockquote>
                        It is forbidden for a man to sleep alone in a house, lest Lilith get hold of him.
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>
                    From this tradition, is has been feared that Lilith will reproduce from the semen of men 
                    as they dream of dreams with her in her seductive ways. In order to understand the fear 
                    of why this would be a problem, we need to examine yet another myth that seems to warp 
                    the meaning of Lilith.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beginning in Genesis 1 of the bible, God made all of life, including the Earth, plants, 
                    and animals. In order to tend to the Earth, God made Adam. As Adam named all the animals, 
                    Adam realized all of the other animals had someone to interact and relate with, 
                    particularly within sexuality, but not them (I use the metaphor of them instead of him 
                    due to the non-dual nature before the split). Because Adam was in their original design, 
                    consisting of both male and female energies, there is an implication androgyny. In order 
                    for Adam to experience the same playing, mating, and relating that all of the other 
                    creatures we able to, God then split them into male and female, rather than one original 
                    being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is one anomaly here, where it is written in Genesis 1:
                </p>
                <div class="quote">
                    <blockquote>
                        {On the fifth day} … And God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. 
                        They shall rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the cattle, the whole earth, 
                        and all of the creeping things that creep on the earth.” And God created man in His 
                        image, He created him; male and female. He created them.
                    </blockquote>
                </div>    
                <p>
                    While in Genesis 2 it gets a little muddy because man is created after the seventh day, 
                    then puts him to sleep in order for a “woman” to become from his rib. It also describes 
                    that Adam was roaming the earth looking for a partner with all of the other life, and 
                    found no compatibility for his own likeness, as if male and female was not created at 
                    the same time.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Around 700-1000 CE, there was a book written, titled “The Alphabet of Ben Sira” which 
                    attempts to link these missing pieces. It is a controversy whether this is an accurate 
                    attempt to fill in missing pieces of the biblical literature, or if it ended up being a 
                    satire, however the impact of it's distribution created a more deeper myth into the 
                    original creations of human.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    In sections 23a-b, the story fills in as Adam and Lilith was made from earth. In their 
                    relationship, Adam continuously demanded to be on top {sexually}, while Lilith expressed 
                    her desire to be side by side, or even herself being on top since they were considered 
                    both equals, made of the same earth. Adam rejected her request expressing he was better 
                    because he was made of earth while arguing Lilith was made of sediment: filth and clay. 
                    Neither budging from both of their demands, Lilith ends up leaving him, and goes to the 
                    Red Sea, refusing subjugation.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    As Lilith chose on her own volition to leave behind Adam, and ultimately Eden, she was 
                    demonized literally.  At an attempt to bring Lilith back, God sent three Angels to 
                    convince her to return, with a message. This message was a threat that for every day she 
                    does not return, her offspring will be killed, a hundred at a time. The mythology attempts 
                    to describe her as a succubus, a female demon that is believed to have sex with sleeping 
                    men, eating babies, and giving birth to demons, hundreds by the day. Even though she is in 
                    a situation where she does not want her own offspring to die, she stands her ground and 
                    essentially makes a deal, saying that she will kill the newborn infants of boys up until 8 
                    days, while killing the girls up to 20 days of age. She will not bring the fate of death to 
                    any new born whom have an amulet that protects those infants.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Since Lilith never came back, Adam complained to God for being lonely, God then made Eve 
                    out of his own flesh, making it real that she could never be equal. Eve thus becomes the 
                    model of the “nice and obedient” girl.

                    This leads us into another story of distraught love. After Lilith leaves Eden, she goes 
                    on to have relations with Samael, whom is the archangel of death, also known as “the 
                    poison of God”. This gives him the title of Satan, or the Devil. It is said that for fear 
                    of creating horrible demons through their sexual nature, Samael is castrated by God to 
                    prevent the destruction of God's creation.

                    Although there is no mention of a specific name within the bible, none-the-less frequently 
                    through out Proverbs, wisdom comes in the form of the feminine with inclusion of the useage 
                    “her” and “she”. In Greek mythology, she is named Sophia. It is where we get Philosophy, 
                    which is translated “love of wisdom”.

                    As Eve came into existence, obedient and submissive, Eve is told never to eat from the 
                    tree of knowledge. Sophia is considered to be the tree of knowledge which will present 
                    the Truth of all things. One day, a serpent hanging from the tree began to converse with 
                    Eve, attempting to convince Eve to take a bite from the fruit off the tree. Eve gave in, 
                    and Eden, along with Adam and Eve, fell into chaos and both were permanently evicted from 
                    Eden. Or perhaps what was truly revealed is the illusion that was casted upon them both 
                    about the idea's of oppression, domination, and control by a single male god?

                    Serpents and snakes have been long considered the primal existence which also, like how 
                    the snake sheds it's skin, is a symbol of death, regeneration, and rebirth. What also is 
                    hidden here is that this serpent, representing the kundalini energy, our prana, life force, 
                    and sexually enlightened energy is in fact Lilith, although it is debatable if it was Samael, 
                    or even both of them riding together. Lilith's motives were to help Eve be remembered in 
                    her truest form is that she is still wild and free, that she is the natural, organic force 
                    of the feminine, and that she can still be an equal to Adam by choosing something from her 
                    own volition, even if it means to be ostracized from a particular society. Lilith thus 
                    becomes Eve's counterpart, friend, and confidant.

                    Lilith was perhaps used as a scapegoat from women who miscarried, infertile, or were 
                    uncomfortable with their own sexuality and sexual behaviors. It is also possible she was 
                    called upon when a woman chose to abort whether through rape pregnancies or simply did not

                    here, if you honor your instinctive, autonomous self, you choose not to be controlled. In 
                    order to survive, the Patriarchal cultural-religion machine needs you to deny your freedom, 
                    your mysterious and instinctual ways, and be compliant. “Do not question your authority, I 
                    know what's best for you,” they say. If it cannot be controlled, then it needs to be

                    This attempt to suppress sexuality has created unimaginable shame and toxicity to the 
                    natural arising of the inherent force that allows life to exist - our own Eros. This 
                    continued suppression is and will continue to scar our bodies and souls with transgressions, 
                    shame, and violence, creating a warped shadow element of sexuality. We essentially are 
                    creating our own chains of oppression further. And it's not just about sex! Our suppressed 
                    Eros can limit our own capacity for creativity and bringing into the world our own sacred 
                    work.

                    Around and before 3000 BCE, matriarchal cultures embraced the mysteries of the feminine, 
                    with an understanding of death and rebirth, and the moon as the Goddess teaching about 
                    regeneration, sex not only as a procreative act, but one of ecstasy, healing, and 
                    spiritual elevation, and the mysteries of the occult and psychic influences(1). It is in 
                    fact referenced that archaeological evidence provides that around 27,000 years ago, 
                    figurines of females were common place around Eurasia, symbolizing sexuality and fertility 
                    through sculpting faceless images including breasts, vulvas, and buttocks. (8)

                    Capricorn has many dimensions and meanings through the lens of that particular 
                    consciousness. I have written other articles investigating some aspects of it, but there

                <p>
                    Capricorn and it's planetary ruler Saturn have a relationship to what we call Natural Law. 
                    In fact, there are two kinds of laws when looking through the lens of Saturn. Liz Greene 
                    explains these laws:
                </p>
                <div class="quote">
                    <blockquote>
                        “...there are also two kinds of laws. Man made laws deal with the structuring of society

                        to its members. Spiritual laws are not very well understood because they can only be 
                        apprehended by their reflection in human behavior... they are simply inherent in life 
                        rather than a product of life; in fact they are perhaps, in a more esoteric sense, the 
                        reason for life.” (10)

                <p>
                    Natural law, or as Greene states Spiritual Law, is the implication that allow reality to 
                    exist as it is on Earth. What is included here is gravity, form, boundaries, time, 
                    structure. Everything that we experience in the natural world, though time specifically 
                    has different meanings depending on the lens through which we look at. If we look at time 
                    as a by-product of what has come before, we can look at our current civilization which 
                    includes all of the technologies, cultures, and rules that exist today. Since Natural Law 
                    exists so we can interact with life and others, human made laws are created in order to 
                    produce a structured society. Human made laws are respective of hierarchical cultures. 
                    There has been a time where Matriarchy was the prime rule-based method, but now we are 
                    faced with referencing the Patriarchy. These human laws are informed by how actions 
                    create consequences. Consequences are not “punishments” but rather the idea of cause and 
                    effect. It has a relationship to Natural Law. For example, living plants, animals, humans, 
                    etc needs water to live. If sources of water are removed, then that particular life will 
                    be threatened toward extinction.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Human laws, again representing the continuation of human societies, can, but doesn't 
                    always, protect certain peoples.  These laws are relative to the particular time and space 
                    within each viewed society lives. Without human laws, anarchy would exist. So societies 
                    create laws that are relative to that particular culture. China and the US have different 
                    laws reflecting those particular cultures. Which lens is appropriate? Both considering the 
                    perspective in which they arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to survive, we must procreate. This implies sex. Sex is very primal and 
                    instinctual in nature, and rather unpredictable. As Natural Law presents a level of 
                    predictability, IE. what goes up must come down due to gravity, even though sex and 
                    sexuality is a by-product of Natural Law, when human made laws come into question, 
                    predictability becomes a allopathic remedy for an otherwise unpredictable, rather raw 
                    expression of sex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Judaeo-Christian religions of the west have created a suppressed nature of our 
                    otherwise instinctual expression of sexuality. Saturn, representing this suppression 
                    through human made laws, has thus created forms of right and wrong within our erotic 
                    energies and desires. As a result, the term “Dark Eros” exists from judging what is 
                    deemed healthy and unhealthy sexuality. When societies suppress sexuality, sexuality 
                    then becomes distorted, unable to express an otherwise organic and natural process of 
                    life.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Dark Eros can mean many concepts, depending on the lens of the society from which we 
                    are viewing. The more suppressed the society, the more “dirty” sex becomes. Taboos of 
                    submission/domination, role-play, and other forms of sexual play become an outlet from 
                    where our dirty secrets have the possibility of being exposed. However, taboos are still 
                    much unspoken, and as a result, societies then have been victimized by this pathology, 
                    which includes rape, shame, and violence.

                    What we can see through the story of Lilith and Samael is that both individuals are quite 
                    empowered through their own choices, living from a sense of autonomy and liberation. The 
                    potential risk that God discovered while witnessing the two lovers organizing together is 
                    highly empowered individuals who won't stand for the intolerance of a controlling and 
                    oppressing God, thus creating more deities (demons) who are of a divine nature.

                    In looking to the etymology of demon, it is from Greek that daimon means “deity, divine 
                    power, lesser god, or guiding spirit”. In the European pagan traditions, there is the 
                    Goddess and the God whom are worshiped.

                    The male deity in particular is named “The Horned God” much to the liking of how we have 
                    painted the Devil. This horned God is the child, the lover, and the consort of the Goddess. 
                    The devil is another figure for the astrological sign of Capricorn, where the symbol is 
                    called the Goat. During the uprise of Judaeo-Christian religions, pagans, translated to 
                    country dwellers, we persecuted for their ways of ritual and prayer, leading to hundreds 
                    of years of rape, murder, and forced converts from an otherwise ancient practice of religion 
                    and union with the divine.

                    Let us look into history for a moment. In the beginnings of the Age of Taurus around 6,000 
                    years ago, this symbolic movement of the age brought up the creation of agriculture. Prior 
                    to that, we had very little structure around organized societies, and we mostly nomadic.

                    In his book, Lilith: Healing the Wild, Tom Jacobs states:

                        mother figure who would protect us... We have learned through this that we need to be 
                        active in how our lives unfold, as being passive and waiting for our mother – the earth 
                        – to bring us all we need. [This was] a stage of human evolution we needed to move beyond.”

                    By taking matters into our own hands, we needed to begin creating systems of agriculture in 
                    order for us evolve our necessary of survival. By being able to utilize the land in a way that 
                    created crops, cattle, and water, small societies could be created around a centralized unit. 
                    There is also a myth that shows the idea that women wanted to have men around their families 
                    more, so the inventions of tools for agriculture were created by women so the men could stay 
                    closer to home, as hunters would potentially be gone for long periods of time.

                    What grew out of this was the stages of needing to possess land because if anyone who was

                    only for the invaders own selfish reasons, then the organized tribe could not survive.

                    Previous cultures had once honored the masculine and feminine as co-creators as renewal of 
                    life. These cultures once had a balanced relationship between women and men, where equality was 
                    the norm and no superiority and domination concepts ruled their civilizations. In the last 100 
                    or so years, we have seen the rise of technological advances which creates such a potentially 
                    huge leap from survival-based living into a thriving-based society, if we can pull together our 
                    resources to include with equality and the prime concept of egalitarianism. With a Patriarchal 
                    culture, or any gender/race/sex based superiority for that matter, there becomes a hierarchical 
                    structure that also creates a mind set that certain peoples are more deserving than others. 
                    There is no equality in gender/race/sex hierarchies. As a result, within the last 100 years, 
                    we have seen increasing amounts of movements for women, POC, and LGTBQ+ rights, among other 
                    marginalized populations. This returning to equality means the reclaiming of the wild feminine, 
                    the reclaiming and invocation of Lilith.

                    Lilith can be seen as a symbol for independent, rebellious, sensual, sexually empowered, 
                    courageous, passionate, free-thinker, and truth seeking activist. She shakes up what the 
                    status quo is and challenges rules in place for what the soul inherently is -  sovereign. 
                    Lilith has such a close relationship with God that she instinctively knows desire is what 
                    makes life move and flow. She knew that there was no authentic desire in Eden, and thus 
                    chose to live out her days in her desire with other deities whom were in contact with 
                    their own desire. This ultimately lead to a price of sacrifice of being cut off from her 
                    origins. In the end she learned she had to say no to what she felt to be untrue to her 
                    nature.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    However, in order to understand a more full picture of Lilith, we have to look at the 
                    perspective of being a victim. A victim only exists when there is a perpetrator. Though 
                    often times a perpetrator is an other that exists outside of ourselves, we also are largely 
                    the victim to our own perpetrator; whether through beliefs and commentary of our own 
                    self-criticism, projected attacks on an invisible enemy, or misinterpreted recollections of 
                    memories that may not be fully accurate, is it excessivly common to create situations in 
                    which we become our own “God of Judgment” and cast ourselves out from our essence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One way Lilith remained a victim was the fact she chose to remain closed-minded. Not to 
                    assume that Adam was acting with reverence and respect, there is only so much information 
                    about the relationship between the two. Was the quarrel about the sexual position something 
                    that was on going, or was it a one time thing? No amount of information that I sought 
                    revealed the level of connection these two had. Filling in the gaps is not appropriate for 
                    an accurate objective look at the story, so we can only take what we know and apply it.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    At first glance, neither were going to compromise their stance, resulting in the idea that 
                    both are responsible for being closed-minded in the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Lilith had made her decision to remain separated from Eden, this choice is an example 
                    in how she chose to suffer. This is key! Why? Because often times we, as humans, do not 
                    take full responsibility for our choice to suffer. There may be an alternative, and we 
                    willfully, though often unconsciously, remain in our patterns of being a victim with no 
                    ownership. Being in ownership here means that I make a choice, and no matter the 
                    consequences of such actions, I am not a victim, resulting in no perpetrator. 
                    Extrapolating this will be very long and quite pointless until one can have a direct 
                    experience of what it means to take full ownership. While that it may be, what is authentic 
                    empowerment?

                    In order to begin returning to Natural Law, we must have a radical acceptance of the 
                    Natural Feminine. Much of the feminine rests within the body, our vessel and temple in 
                    which we move within this life. The feminine and the body it's self, holds a tremendous 
                    amount of wisdom that is ours to connect with. If one thinks about how so many systems 
                    within our bodies are somehow attempting to create homeostatis, balance, and does heal it's 
                    self without us ever having to think about those processes or how to do it, reveals that 
                    inherent wisdom ever-so natural to us: our birthright.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many are healing and releasing the imprinted gender defining roles which includes how 
                    individuals are meant to embody their creative and sexual force. At times, sex has been 
                    used as a form of control by the cultural-religious machine, in one example to ensure a man 
                    knows who his children are. One way this is healed is by reconnecting with the Masculine 
                    and the Feminine within us, regardless of gender. Also, instinctive sex is natural sex; it 
                    has no rules and no expectations. It honors each person to explore the self and the other.

                    In Lilith's Fire, Deborah Scott illustrates a beautiful statement which gives expression 
                    to the whole nature of both Lilith and Eve:
                </p>            
                <div class="quote">
                    <blockquote>
                        “If we are to become whole as individuals, if change is to manifest in our 
                        relationships, women must find a way to integrate both the Eve and the Lilith in themselves 
                        with pride instead of 	guilt, and men must learn to appreciate both sides of a woman's 
                        nature without passing 	judgment.” (4)

                    Another connection to our dark feminine is unapologetically honoring the self. Aligning 
                    with and embodying your convictions will create self-respect and autonomy. This includes 
                    getting in touch with saying yes and no when you mean it with out apologizing. This requires 
                    telling the truth even when it is unpopular. If you have ever witnessed the impact of truth 
                    telling, it can be difficult, so being open to change and flowing with circumstance while 
                    remaining in integrity and knowing who you are. And finally honoring the Natural flow of your 
                    emotions. Emotions aren't bad, yet there is a time and place in where emotions can be fully 
                    felt and understood. Ensuring the best outcome of your expression, learn to be in charge of 
                    you, not in or out of control.

                    The etymology of desire comes from Latin “de” meaning down from and “sidus” meaning 
                    heavenly body, star, or constellation. De sidere, also latin, is from the stars. Is it 
                    not part of the heavens to desire? Is sexual nature not a fundamental element in the 
                    creation of the Universe, that which we are inherently a part of, not separate from? 
                    Reconnecting with sexual desires and instincts is another path to healing the wild feminine. 
                    Having sex when you want to, why you do it, how and how often, and with whom works best for 
                    you is your choice and gift. Tuning in and learning when to say yes and no is the key here. 
                    You are in charge of your sexuality, and even celibacy is a wonderful choice, considering 
                    it's authentically coming from your own body and not some pressure to conform to a societal 
                    standard, or a by-product of unresolved trauma. Be sure to allow the natural ebbs and flows 
                    of sexual energy, interest, passion, and desire. Like all things, our sexual energy changes. 
                    Remembering to recognize sex as a doorway to open you and you-with-others to you divine self.

                    Recognize that we live in a world that is taught to fear the natural feminine and 
                    diminish the packaged feminine. There is a lot of rage showing up from the thousands of 
                    years of oppression and suppression, so forgiveness may take time, if it even becomes 
                    available. It is unfortunate, but so many of our ancestors have been players in this 
                    construct both men, women, and other. And all genders and sexes have been abused and hurt 
                    through this system, so when connecting to the wild feminine, this is not gendered, as both 
                    feminine and masculine energies are available to everyone, and all have been affected.

                    Lilith as a role model is a person who serves as a catalyst for change, being a symbol 
                    for both women and men, being able to freely express their sexuality, protects their own 
                    mind, body, and spiritual, emotional, and physical independence.. She doesn't run away from 
                    her rage when there is reason to be rageful, doesn't hide behind social conventions, and 
                    isn't afraid of raising her voice or the retribution that act might bring. Pg 32 of

                    There is a large divide between women and men, between people of color and white. There is 
                    much division in our world period. When it comes to a patriarchal culture, it seems that 
                    all genders have healing work to do with each other. What I am about to write is simply a 
                    personal opinion based upon the limited perspective of the moment.

                    It can be fearful seeing very powerful women start to rise up, with capacities and gifts 
                    we may only dream of to wield. But these gifts are not personal nor possessable. They are 
                    gifts originating from the divine, something that only the wielder can use temporarily. 
                    I personally have asked myself “what value do I hold in a world where women are in 
                    positions of power? What usefulness do I hold when there is no one to protect or provide 
                    for as women become self-reliant and independent?” These questions have plagued my mind 
                    for years. While I still don't have an answer, the one thing I do feel is true is to 
                    connect with our own inner feminine, our hearts, and our bodies. We need to come together 
                    as brothers once again and share vulnerable space with another man. Coming together to 
                    discuss and create ways of how we can support these women for a better future that includes 
                    everyone, erasing discrimination rather than the dark. We need to be safe in our hearts so 
                    that women can rest and regenerate in our arms from the tireless effort they make in the 
                    world. Women need and want to trust us. Most importantly, we need to know who we are 
                    without women in our lives, standing side-by-side in brotherhood and reconnect with our 
                    own wild with each other.

                    It is undeniable that we men have hurt you, possessed you, oppressed you. It is not our 
                    fault for the way society is, but it is our responsibility to change ourselves. I hear the 
                    depth of distrust you feel around men, and reasonably so. However, keeping the stories 
                    that men are rapist, murderer, and ultimately hazardous will continue to perpetuate the 
                    stories of duality and fear. It is up to everyone to do their own inner work. It is time to 
                    step out of being a victim and know your truth in the cycle of life. Being a victim 
                    perpetuates there is a perpetrator. You have always had your power, and like the moon, 
                    there came a time to go into regeneration. Your time is now, and we want to see your magic 
                    and beauty in the world. We all want to be healed, though some may not have the knowledge of 
                    that itch, or the words to say so. Everything has a birth, death, and regeneration cycle. 
                    You are now being reborn. Call forth your true wild nature, standing naked before the 
                    surging power of a giant waterfall, the chaos of a hurricane, and heat of a wildfire and 
                    know in your hearts that this unfettered expression of the wild creates the infinite 
                    possibilities for new life to occur.

                <p class="pblog">
                    Being in control is a form of suppression. It essentially means something is wild, untamed, 
                    and unpredictable. Controlling creates predictability. Life in it's true essence is 
                    unpredictable. With so many variables and unknowns, to be in control only creates a false 
                    sense of security. Security is really an illusion, though a really seductive one. The only 
                    real security is inner security, which takes on a different process of being in charge.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    The difference between being in control and being in charge is quite a distinct feature. 
                    Being in control, again, means to suppress. Being in charge, on the other hand, means being 
                    fully present and responsive to what is arising. Being in control is a reaction to fear, 
                    while being in charge is including and surrendering into fear. Controlling doesn't include; 
                    it negates.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Surrendering into fear does not mean giving up into fear. Surrendering is an acknowledgment 
                    and choosing to not know. Not knowing what will happen. Not knowing how others will 
                    perceive me/you/us. Not knowing gives room for what really is, and not what we expect it to 
                    be. Surrendering and being in charge in fact gives freedom, and the ultimate freedom I am 
                    speaking towards is our authentic and wild self. The self is a mystery, something that even 
                    through an entire lifetime cannot fully ever be knowable. Because we may fear what we don't 
                    know, we have an opportunity to surrender into that fear, ultimately surrendering into our 
                    selves.

                    equality are somewhat synonymous. In the end, all things end. Death will come to each one 
                    of us, no matter how saintly or demonic we become. Death is the ultimate leveling field, 
                    ensuring honest equality. Some day this earth will too die, the Sun will burn out, and 
                    perhaps something new will arise from the ashes, though this will be far from noticeable 
                    in our civilization. However, we will die ourselves some day. It is unfortunate that our 
                    modern culture abhors death, and anything of the nuance of it, but we have an opportunity 
                    to get real with ourselves and know we will pass. This is a fear we spend our whole lives 
                    avoiding. But the path of the warrior embraces fear, invites it in, creates a relationship 
                    with it. Ultimately, when we create a relationship with fear around death, we begin to 
                    create a relationship with an ultimate Truth, as well as our own unknowable mystery. Death 
                    is only an stranger when we do not look within ourselves.

                    Like the cycles of the moon, disappearing for three days, death is also a symbol for 
                    renewal and regeneration. With the hopes of rejuvenating from a long journey, death can 
                    bring us into a new frame work of understanding with the idea that all things shall pass, 
                    and as they arise again, may we grow wiser, more compassionate, and having more 
                    understanding with a new opportunity to start once again.

                        “Eros is a sensuous, transformative, whole-making wisdom that emerges with the 
                        subjective engagement of the whole heart in relationships. Erotic power is the power 
                        of our primal interrelatedness.” (7)

                    Belonging is something we all desire. To belong comes from the root langian which means 
                    “to pertain to, to go along with.” If we mix with the previous translation of desire with 
                    belong, we come up with “to go along with the stars.” Our desire is our natural belonging, 
                    our union with the divine. Lilith's own desire is her inherent birthright, just as ours. 
                    Lilith is inseperable from our own being, and thus calling Lilith home into our bodies, 
                    our home and temple, our own sacred garden with her own unique creative vision. It is 
                    within Eden can she bring desire to a once desireless kingdom, creating a magnificent wonder 
                    of beauty and liberation, of hearts being healed, where soverignty and equality both exist.

                    Though everything is cyclical, this is a time to recognize the potential we have with 
                    asking Lilith to return to our hearts. Astrologically speaking, there is a lot of Capricorn 
                    energy occurring at this moment, and even more potent energy to come as of January 2020. I 
                    find it highly relevant to dive into this topic of suppressed human law and reconnect with 
                    Natural Law. This is not a prediction, but an invitation.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Capricorn resembles structure, Saturn represents strengthening, Pluto represents 
                    destruction in order to regenerate, Ceres is the Dark mother, also representing an aspect 
                    of Lilith, and Jupiter representing expansion. In short, we have an opportunity to destroy 
                    the old ways that structure and form has suppressed and oppressed us in order to strengthen 
                    and return to the old ways of Natural Law, especially and including sexuality. As we begin 
                    to explore a new version of society, one that includes the wild feminine, equality can 
                    begin to unite us once again back to Eden, valuing Lilith for her essence and wisdom.

                <p>
                    As we have explored, the wildness of the feminine, it's unpredictability, was a roadblock 
                    to structuring society as it is today. Not assuming that our modern society is a healthy 
                    and empowered place to exist in, none-the-less this is where we are at in our history. 
                    These human structures, now existing on old foundations, are no longer serving the growth 
                    and development of society and consciousness. Even if we disagree with how disconnected 
                    we've become from the natural law, there is a mystery still unfolding before our eyes, 
                    minds, and hearts and a particular future that is yet to be written. From this vantage 
                    point, we can begin to reclaim and remember the forgotten, but not lost ways of the wild 
                    feminine, and once again reunite with spirit and form through our instinctual energies of 
                    sex, creating healing and ecstasy through interplay of self and other. The more we confront 
                    our “shadow” and “dark”, we can once again remember that the dark is not to be feared, and 
                    instead reminding us of the regenerative effects of being in the unknown.
