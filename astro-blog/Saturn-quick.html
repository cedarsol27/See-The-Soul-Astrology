                <p>
                    Saturn is our body, our form. It gives us the definition of our structure. Anything that gives 
                    us structure also strengthens us. How we are strengthened in reality is how we mature. Maturation 
                    gives us the ability to operate in a socially confined reality, thus revealing our authority. 
                    Authority governs rules which are needed to operate successfully in a social reality. To operate 
                    in a social reality means we must be able to conform to that social structure. A social structure 
                    create hierarchy, however within a hierarchy we are invited to establish our own inner authority. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    All things requiring a structure and form also define a finite reality. There is an edge, a boundary, 
                    a limitation. Being able to develop in this also gives rise to that wisdom that says “this is what I 
                    know I can do, and what I cannot do.” Being able to do and not do also requires a linear time, and 
                    cycles in order to do them. Cycles are forms of contracts, and contracts describe what is legal and 
                    not legal.

                    Saturn gives us the ability to strengthen and ground ourselves in a physical and social reality. As 
                    part of our soul's desire, being able to strengthen ourselves here and now helps to achieve a balance 
                    to discover ourselves as human first, and become our own authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, Saturn in Sagittarius states strengthening one's self requires defining one's self in 
                    their own truth. Limitations within belief structures are occurring to know one's own truth through 
                    many different kinds of philosophies, cultures, and education systems. One's requirement to go beyond 
                    opinions and see other's truths and realities can create a definition of what is true for me, and then 
                    strengthen that truth within a social environment. Saturn will test those beliefs to see how 
                    sustainable they are, and how they will stand the test of time. If a belief has little basis in 
                    reality, then that truth will break down. Any sort of break down can result in a new form, as long as 
                    there is a maturity within the individual or system to be able to begin learning the lessons of how 
                    others are impacted by a particular social structure, and begin to live out the rules established 
                    within themselves. This is like asking the question, “does it grow corn?” If it cannot, then the 
                    practicality and reality of that belief structure will fade out within a linear time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saturn in the 5th house will state how self-expression is or is not strengthened. If someone's sense 
                    of personality is weak, then others will easily take advantage of that person. Many upsets will come 
                    in the form of social hierarchy to create a form around that individual expression. Being a self in a 
                    social environment will produce a necessity to become a unique self, centered in the self, and say,” 
                    you must be you, first.” Otherwise attempting to become someone else will only be broken down, until 
                    one's self is truly becoming discovered.
                </p>

                    Essentially this signature of Saturn in Sagittarius in the 5th house says, you must structure your 
                    own beliefs and express your self through your own inner authority, but still participate with others.
