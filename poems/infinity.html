                Plaster on these walls a million faces<br>
                Hollowing through thousands of places<br>
                Leaving marks on the surface of the skin<br>
                Reminding the power held within<br>
                The craze has become addicted for more<br>
                Breaking the skin weaker than before<br>
                Scarring the eyes melting the mind<br>
                For ourselves we've lost never to find<br>
                Sweeping the dirt under the rug<br>
                Catches our heart with a pull to tug<br>
                Losing the ring that once was there<br>
                Hiding the pain for which we dare not bear<br>
                As I walk this path with eyes and smiles<br>
                Past the people for many miles<br>
                I see colors never seen before<br>
                Taking my hand and placing in on a door<br>
                More and more the doors appear<br>
                To see many faces now filled with fear<br>
                Further down and with my surprise<br>
                I see faces with anger in their eyes<br>
                For days it seems I talk to walls<br>
                Hearing their triumphs and hearing their falls<br>
                I take one step and I seem to remember<br>
                I've walked from January until December<br>
                Back to January I seem to see<br>
                The beginning of the path which started with me<br>
                I stare at the face next to another<br>
                I stare at the faces of me and my brother<br>
                And my sister and father and mother and friends<br>
                And I've realized this from beginning to end<br>
                Life is a surprise with many faces<br>
                We travel the world to many places<br>
                And still these walls which we've seen before<br>
                All link together through every door<br>
                We all come from the same source<br>
                From some infinite unknown force<br>
                As I leave this place with my spirit held high<br>
                I remember the fact in which I cannot die<br>
                These people are a part of me<br>
                As I just as much as a part of thee<br>
                We together build this home<br>
                A burning desire and never alone<br>
                All the feeling we experience through life<br>
                Can be wonderful or a painful strife<br>
                So as I disappear into the wind<br>
                One last voice is spoken within<br>
                I always was and will always be<br>
                I am forever, My name, Infinity<br></p>
