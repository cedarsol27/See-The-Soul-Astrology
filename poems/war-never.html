            <h1>The War That Never Was</h1>
            <hr>
            <article class="poetry">
                <p>
                    All my heart is protected by chains<br>
                    All I could ever feel, just outside the door<br>
                    All the blessings, I don't want to know<br>
                    All the love in misery, I don't want to feel<br>
                    Confused as to why I chained this heart<br>
                    Carrying around the burden of dead weight<br>
                    The punishment of my stories my stubbornness persists<br>
                    A war long past, I carry my weapon<br>
                    To defend upon any aggressor, my self the worst<br>
                    To wake and aware, the danger of something sealed<br>
                    So precious, so real, so meaningful<br>
                    But don't come near as I fear this cannot be undone<br>
                    Why throw myself into the flames of love<br>
                    When being away has provided such comfort<br>
                    I care not of illness, because the imagery is so alluring<br>
                    I care not of beauty, because despair is lustful<br>
                    And I am a man of instant gratification<br>
                    This permanent guarantee is my only validation<br>
                    Do not whisper in my ear that you are here, my Love<br>
                    As I am committed to living a life of war<br>
                    Even as you wait, relentlessly<br>
                    For now I must disagree<br>
                    But the only words that ever penetrate<br>
                    Is that you are always here<br>
                    When I am ready<br>
                    When I tire<br>
                    When I surrender<br>
                    And then, I will realize my chains were never real<br>
                    And I will be that tenderness and softness<br>
                    I have always been<br>
                    And to know that this war I waged<br>
                    Never was there<br>
